###Good Plot###
#Data Source: World Bank's indicator TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS, which represents high-technology exports as a #percentage of manufactured exports. (data.worldbank.org) 

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(WDI)

# Define the indicator for high-technology exports (% of manufactured exports)
indicator <- "TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS"

# Specify selected countries: South Korea, Germany, USA
countries <- c("KOR", "DEU", "USA")  

# Fetch data from the World Bank API (only from 2010 to 2020)
tech_exports <- WDI(indicator = indicator, country = countries, start = 2010, end = 2020)

# Data Wrangling
tech_exports_clean <- tech_exports %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  rename(
    country = country,
    year = year,
    high_tech_exports = TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS
  )

# Create plot
ggplot(tech_exports_clean, aes(x = year, y = high_tech_exports, color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +         
  geom_point(size = 2) +          
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2010, 2020), breaks = seq(2010, 2020, by = 2)) +  
  labs(
    title = "High-Technology Exports as a % of Manufactured Exports (2010-2020)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "High-Technology Exports (%)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )

```

Why is it a good plot?
- Titles and axis labels provide context to the data
- consistent scales and distinguishable colours/ simple design allows easy comparison between countries
- The plot shows trends over time for each country

###Bad Plot### 
#(same Data as above)

# load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(WDI)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Fetch real high-tech export data (2010-2020) for Korea, Germany, USA
tech_exports <- WDI(indicator = "TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS", country = c("KOR", "DEU", "USA"), start = 2010, end = 2020)

# Data wrangling
tech_exports_clean <- tech_exports %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  rename(
    country = country,
    year = year,
    high_tech_exports = TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS
  )

# Generate bad color palette
ugly_colors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "Spectral"))(15)  

# Create bar chart
ggplot(tech_exports_clean, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = high_tech_exports, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = runif(nrow(tech_exports_clean), 0.1, 1.2)) + #random bar widths
  scale_fill_manual(values = ugly_colors) + 
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "limegreen"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "hotpink"),  
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 5, color = "purple"),   
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", color = "orange"),  
    legend.title = element_text(size = 18, color = "blue") 
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "High-Tech Export Chart (2010-2020)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Exports % ",
    fill = "Country"
  )

```
Why is it a bad plot?
- colours used are indistinguishable and distracting
- Barplot is generally not a good idea to visualize this type of data (way too much information on one bar, we can not see a trend over time for the different countries)
- bars have irregular widths which makes it even more confusing
- x axis ist not readable
- title and axis labels are generally not very clear and don't provide context to the data
